# Github Actions and Kubernetes on Azure

This tutorial explains how to set up a basic "infrastructure as code"-pipeline in Github to create a Kubernetes cluster in Azure using Azure Kubernetes Service, AKS.

## Azure subscription

To complete the tutorial, you need an Azure subscription. If you do not have one already, you can create a free 12-month subscription here: <https://azure.microsoft.com/free>

## Github account 

Also, you need a Github account. If you do not have one, create one for free here: <https://github.com/join>

At the end of the sign-up, you may be asked to create your first repository, but you don't have to that for now.

## Azure Portal

To make sure you are correctly setup with a working subscription, make sure you can log in to the Azure portal. Go to <https://portal.azure.com>

## Azure Cloud Shell

Azure Cloud Shell is a web based shell which has a lot of good tools pre-installed (like kubectl, az cli, helm, etc).

Start cloud shell by typing the address ````shell.azure.com```` into a web browser. If you have not used cloud shell before, you will be asked to create a storage location for cloud shell. Accept that and make sure that you run bash as your shell (not powershell).


## Create a service principal
You need to somehow allow Github to act on "your behalf" when deploying things in Azure. The way this is done, is by creating a **Service Principal**. 

The service principal is simply an identity. You can configure this identity to be allowed to do various things in your azure subscription. 

The easiest way to create a service principal is by using **azure cli**, a.k.a ````az````. 

Lets use Azure CLoud shell to do this. In your cloud shell, do the following:

````bash
az ad sp create-for-rbac --sdk-auth --name actionsSP
````

Output from this command is a json object, and should look something like the below. You will need this output in a later step, so keep it available somehow.
````
{
  "clientId": "8e65cbad-bc58-4cc7-88f4-4eada9450c7d",
  "clientSecret": "869118ba-a0e1-4bd7-a746-fbeda735bdc6",
  "subscriptionId": "6f65205f-d352-482f-970b-a1d2a478fb64",
  "tenantId": "72f543bf-86f1-41af-91ab-2d7cd011db47",
  "activeDirectoryEndpointUrl": "https://login.microsoftonline.com",
  "resourceManagerEndpointUrl": "https://management.azure.com/",
  "activeDirectoryGraphResourceId": "https://graph.windows.net/",
  "sqlManagementEndpointUrl": "https://management.core.windows.net:8443/",
  "galleryEndpointUrl": "https://gallery.azure.com/",
  "managementEndpointUrl": "https://management.core.windows.net/"
}
````

For instance, copy this and paste it into a text editor.

## Fork Github repository

The easiest way to get the code for this tutorial, is by **forking** the Github repository where I put my code. Forking means that you copy the contents of my repository into a repository in your github account (itÂ´s OK! This is open source after all :-)

To fork the repository, first navigate to <https://github.com/pelithne/aks-pipeline> then select the **fork** button in the top right corner. 

<p align="left">
  <img width=100%" src="./media/fork.PNG">
</p>

You should now get a forked repository in your account, which looks similar to this:

<p align="left">
  <img width=100%" src="./media/forked-repo.PNG">
</p>

When you browse around the files, you will notice that the repository has some template files in the ```` 	arm-templates```` folder, and a pipeline definition in ````.github/workflows````. 

The templates are actually **ARM Templates** (Azure Resource Management Templates) and contain the defintions of the resources you will deploy to azure (in this case, a Kubernetes cluster). More about this later.

## Create the Service Principal Secret

As mentioned before, in order for Github actions to be able to interact with Azure, it needs an identity. For this you will use the service principal you created in a previous step.

In order for Github to be "made aware" of this identity, you will add it into the **secrets vault** in Github. This secret will be referenced by the pipeline.

To import the secret to Github, first select **settings** to the right in your github toolbar.

<p align="left">
  <img width=100%" src="./media/settings.png">
</p>
 
Then selclick on **secrets** in the left hand navigation bar

<p align="left">
  <img width=30%" src="./media/secrets.PNG">
</p>

After this, select **Add new secret** and paste in the entire json object you (hopefully saved before).

Reminder, it should look similar to this:

````
{
  "clientId": "8e65cbad-bc58-4cc7-88f4-4eada9450c7d",
  "clientSecret": "869118ba-a0e1-4bd7-a746-fbeda735bdc6",
  "subscriptionId": "6f65205f-d352-482f-970b-a1d2a478fb64",
  "tenantId": "72f543bf-86f1-41af-91ab-2d7cd011db47",
  "activeDirectoryEndpointUrl": "https://login.microsoftonline.com",
  "resourceManagerEndpointUrl": "https://management.azure.com/",
  "activeDirectoryGraphResourceId": "https://graph.windows.net/",
  "sqlManagementEndpointUrl": "https://management.core.windows.net:8443/",
  "galleryEndpointUrl": "https://gallery.azure.com/",
  "managementEndpointUrl": "https://management.core.windows.net/"
}
````

The name of the secret should be **AZURE_CREDENTIALS**. (it could be anything, but the pipeline definition expects this name, so if you name it differently there will be some extra hacking).

Don't forget to click **Add Secret**

## Activate Actions

When you forked the repository, you also copied the pipeline definition. However, github will deactivate the pipeline on forked repos, so you need to activate it again.

Do that by cliking on **actions** in the Github toolbar

<p align="left">
  <img width=100%" src="./media/actions.png">
</p>

You will be asked to to activate workflows. Do that.

<p align="left">
  <img width=100%" src="./media/activate-actions.PNG">
</p>

After this, things get a bit unintuitive (at least for now). You need to head back to the repository files, by selecting **code** in the Github toolbar, and then navigate to ````.github/workflows````.  

You should see something similar to this

<p align="left">
  <img width=100%" src="./media/yaml-pipeline.PNG">
</p>

Now, in order for this pipeline to "really" become activated, you need to edit the file and make a new commit. To edit the file, select the pen icon to the left:


<p align="left">
  <img width=30%" src="./media/pen.png">
</p>

After opening the file you could for instance add a comment on the second line after the hash-sign (````#````).

Then commit the change by clicking the **start commit** button

<p align="left">
  <img width=15%" src="./media/start-commit.PNG">
</p>

Give the commit a *good* description and click on **Commit changes** to complete the commit.

This will "save" your change to the repository, and at the same time trigger off the pipeline that will build your AKS Kubernetes cluster.

## Actions

If all went well, a new workflow should have been triggered by yout commit. You can follow the progress of that workflow under that actions tab on the Github toolbar. 

The name of the worksflow should be "AzureARMTest" and there should be a "job" named "build-infra". If you click on "build-infra" you can monitor the progress of the job (or possibly identify errors that prevents the pipeline from finishing...).

Creating an AKS cluster takes a while, perhaps 7-8 minutes. After this you can go into the Azure portal and confirm that your cluster is up and running.

## More details about the pipeline/workflow

If you are curious how the pipeline definition and ARM template works together, I will try to explain that in a little bit more detail. 

First, lets start with the pipeline (a.k.a **workflow**). The definition looks something like this:

````yaml
on: [push]

env:
  AZURE_RESOURCE_GROUP: action-rg
  ARM_TEMPLATE_FILE: template.json
  ARM_PARAMETERS_FILE: params.json

name: AzureARMTest

jobs:
  build-infra:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps: 
    # Azure login   
    - uses: azure/login@v1
      with:
        creds: ${{ secrets.AZURE_CREDENTIALS }}
    # Create Resource Group
    - run: az group create -l westeurope -n ${{ env.AZURE_RESOURCE_GROUP }}
    # Check out code to the agent
    - uses: actions/checkout@v1
    # create AKS cluster using ARM templates
    - run: az group deployment create -n test -g ${{ env.AZURE_RESOURCE_GROUP }} --template-file ${{ env.ARM_TEMPLATE_FILE }} --parameters params.json
      working-directory: ./arm-templates
````

The first line ````on: [push]```` tells us that the workflow will be executed when something is pushed to the repository. This is what triggered the worksflow to run when you previously committed a change to a file in the repository.

The next few lines are environment variables, which are used for substitution of values in the worksflow;

````yaml
env:
  AZURE_RESOURCE_GROUP: action-rg
  ARM_TEMPLATE_FILE: template.json
  ARM_PARAMETERS_FILE: params.json
````

After this, the ````jobs:```` tag indicates the start of the workflow, which is called ````build-infra````. 

````runs-on: ubuntu-latest```` means that this job will be run on an agent (a virtual machine) that has the latest Ubuntu OS. I a production grade pipeline, you would obviously want to be more specific than that, and use a specific Ubuntu version.

After ````steps```` comes the different, well, steps of the workflow. First we log into Azure using the credentials stored in Github:

````yaml
# Azure login   
    - uses: azure/login@v1
      with:
        creds: ${{ secrets.AZURE_CREDENTIALS }}
````

Then a resource group is created, using the **Azure CLI** with the ````az group create```` command. The resource group is the "container" for the resources in Azure. All resources that exist in Azure must "live" inside a **Resource Group**

````yaml
# Create Resource Group
    - run: az group create -l westeurope -n ${{ env.AZURE_RESOURCE_GROUP }}
````

The next section checks out the "code" (which is actually the ARM templates that define the infrastructure) from the repository to make sure it's available on the build agent where the workflow is running

````yaml
# Check out code to the agent
    - uses: actions/checkout@v1
````

Finally, the AKS cluster is created, using Azure CLI

````yaml
# create AKS cluster using ARM templates
    - run: az group deployment create -n test -g ${{ env.AZURE_RESOURCE_GROUP }} --template-file ${{ env.ARM_TEMPLATE_FILE }} --parameters params.json
      working-directory: ./arm-templates
````

This last command, uses two files as input, a template file and a parameter file. The template file contains the basic definitions of the ARM template, and the parameters file contains parameters which are inserted into the template.

The template file looks like this:

````yaml
{  
    "$schema":"https://schema.management.azure.com/schemas/2019-04-01/deploymentTemplate.json#",
    "contentVersion":"1.0.0.0",

As you may have noticed, the template file contains references to the **parameters**. These are defined in the parameters file:
